      "abstract": "The Karaha-Talagabodas field is located on the east side of the ancient Bandung-Garut caldera and adjacent to the Galunggung volcano in West Java, Indonesia. Karaha-Talagabodas are two distinct locations separated by approximately 10 km. Geochemical analysis including major, trace and rare earth elements has been done using Fusion ICP-MS to find out how the different composition of volcanic rocks in the two regions (Karaha and Talagabodas). The volcanic rocks of the Karaha-Talagabodas field were composed of pyroxene andesite, andesite basaltic, basalt, highly altered pyroclastic and tuff breccia. The identified alteration minerals are indicated by the presence of kaolinite, halloysite, silica, sericite and chlorite. Geochemically, these volcanic rocks contain SiO2 variable (49.94%-62.27%), Na2O (3.02%-3.83%) and K2O (0.46%-1.78%). Based on the major element diagram of rock chemistry (Na2O+K2O vs SiO2). It shows rocks consisting of calc-alkaline for andesite from Karaha basalt, basaltic andesite and andesite formed in tholeiitic environments on Talagabodas volcanic rocks. Trace element data for host volcanic rocks are provided by this study to identify the magmatic arc system and distribution of subduction components. The normalized REE diagram of N-Morb shows the similarity of the pattern of all Talagabodas volcanic rocks, only Karaha andesite rocks show slight REE enrichment and europium depletion.",

      "abstract": "The Gacun deposit is a typical Volcanic Hosted Massive Sulfide (VHMS) associated with Late Triassic seafloor calc-alkaline felsic volcanics. Studies of zircon ages, petrology, major and trace element geochemistry, and Sr-Nd-Hf isotope geochemistry of volcanic rocks from the Northern Yidun arc were undertaken in this paper. We reshaped the Gacun magmatic system activity time, defined the origin of magma evolution, and proposed a metallogenic model of the deposit. Whole-rock major element compositions of the magmatic rocks in the Northern Yidun island arc indicate that they are a complete basalt–andesite–dacite–rhyolite assemblage, showing three obvious stages of composition evolution. They are enriched in large-ion lithophile and light rare earth elements, but depleted in high field-strength and heavy rare earth elements, with weak-to-negligible Eu anomalies (obvious in rhyolite). These geochemical features indicate that the Northern Yidun island arc is a magmatic arc based on ancient continental crust. The Ganzi–Litang oceanic subduction induced mantle melting and produced calc-alkaline basaltic magma, while the MASH processes at the bottom of the crust produced andesitic magma. Part of the andesite magma erupted to form andesite lava. The remaining part was mixed with magma produced via anatexis of ancient crust (approximately 20%–40% of the ancient crustal component), forming the ore-bearing rhyolite. Zircon U-Pb age data defines Gacun magmatic–hydrothermal mineralization sequence of events: At 238 Ma, arc magmatism led to the formation of andesite in the eastern part of the deposit. At 233 Ma, in the arc zone (the western part of Gacun deposit), a large-scale bimodal magmatism formed the main ore-bearing rock series of Gacun deposit, rhyolitic volcanic rocks. At 221 Ma, volcanic eruptions tended to end and sub-volcanic intrusion occurred, forming a lava dome, which was located under the ore-bearing rhyolitic volcanic rocks. The lava dome acted as a thermal engine and promoted hydrothermal circulation. The hydrothermal activity reached a peak at 217 ± 1 Ma, and the Gacun VHMS deposit was formed.",

A significant difference was revealed between the distribution of silica contents in the rocks and melts: intermediate compositions are most common among the rocks, whereas the melts are dominantly silicic. The distribution of major and trace element was analyzed. It was shown that the contents of some elements are environment-specific (e. g., Nb and light REE). We distinguished trace element ratios in melts that most strongly correlate with the geodynamic setting.",

The final episode is represented by the intrusions in the Ningzhen area, however no contemporaneous volcanic rocks have been reported. In this study, we present an integrated analysis of petrology, zircon U-Pb ages, and whole rock major-trace elements for newly identified volcanic rocks in the Beixiangshan area. Zircon U-Pb dating yields an eruption age of 106.3 ± 0.4 Ma, indicating that these rocks likely belong to the lower part of the Pukou Formation. The volcanic rocks exhibit arc-like geochemical features, distinct from those of the intrusions in the Ningzhen area. The volcanic rocks may be formed during a tectonic transition phase from compression to extension, due to the direction changes of plate convergence. The widespread angular unconformity around the volcanic rocks may represent episode C of the Yanshanian tectonic event, based on the dating work on volcanic rocks, its minimum age should be ca. 106 Ma.",

      "abstract": "The discoveries of oil and gas reservoirs in the volcanic rocks of the Songliao Basin (SB) have attracted the attention of many researchers. However, the lack of studies on the genesis of the volcanic rocks has led to different opinions being presented for the genesis of the SB. In order to solve this problem, this study selected the volcanic rocks of the Yingcheng Formation in the Southern Songliao Basin (SSB) as the research object, and determined the genesis and tectonic setting of the volcanic rocks by using LA‐ICP‐MS zircon U‐Pb dating and a geochemical analysis method (major elements, trace elements, and Hf isotopes). The volcanic rocks of the Yingcheng Formation are mainly composed of rhyolites with minor dacites and pyroclastic rocks. Our new zircon U‐Pb dating results show that these volcanic rocks were erupted in the Early Cretaceous (113–118 Ma). The primary zircons from the rhyolites have ∊Hf (t) values of +4.70 to +12.46 and two‐stage model age (TDM2) of 876–374 Ma. The geochemical data presented in this study allow these rhyolites to be divided into I‐type rhyolites and A‐type rhyolites, both of which were formed by the partial melting of the crust. They have SiO2 contents of 71.62 wt.%–75.76 wt.% and Al2O3 contentsof 10.88 wt.% to 12.92 wt.%. The rhyolites have distinctively higher REE contents than those of ordinary granites, with obvious negative Eu anomalies. The light to heavy REE fractionation is not obvious, and the LaN/YbN (average value = 9.78) is less than 10. The A‐type rhyolites depleted in Ba, Sr, P, and Ti, with relatively low Nb/Ta, indicating that the rocks belong A2 subtype granites formed in an extensional environment. The adakitic dacites are characterized by high Sr contents (624 to 1,082 ppm), low Y contents (10.6 to 12.6 ppm), high Sr/Y and Sr/Yb ratios, and low Mg# values (14.77 to 36.46), indicating that they belong to “C” type adakites. The adakitic dacite with high Sr and low Yb were likely generated by partial melting of the lower crust under high pressure conditions at least 40 km depth. The I‐type rhyolites with low Sr and high Yb, and the A‐type rhyolites with very low Sr and high Yb, were formed in the middle and upper crust under low pressure conditions, respectively. In addition, the formation depths of the former were approximately 30 km, whereas those of the latter were less than 30 km. The geochemical characteristics reveal that the volcanic rocks of Yingcheng Formation were formed in an extensional environment which was related to the retreat of subducted Paleo‐Pacific Plate. At the late Early Cretaceous Period, the upwelling of the asthenosphere mantle and the lithosphere delamination caused by the retreat of the subducted Paleo‐Pacific Plate, had resulted in lithosheric extension in the eastern part of China. Subsequently, a large area of volcanic rocks had formed. The SB has also been confirmed to be a product of the tectonic stress field in that region.",

      "abstract": "Petrography and geochemical data of the Late Cretaceous clastic rocks in the northern Songliao Basin were used to infer the provenance and chemical weathering history. Petrographic data indicates that the composition of the sandstones is mainly quartz (34.48–50.43%), feldspars (14.16%–24.07%) and lithic fragments (33.91%–45.9%). Similar REE patterns and trace element ratios suggest that both the sandstones (LaCN/YbCN = 12.97; Eu/Eu* = 0.81; Th/Sc = 1.10) and mudstones (LaCN/YbCN = 10.02; Eu/Eu* = 0.71; Th/Sc = 1.10) were derived from a similar source area with felsic volcanic rocks as dominant contributors. The main provenance area is probably the eastern Zhangguangcai Range, the north‐eastern Lesser Xing'an Range and the south‐eastern Songliao Basin. A modelled mixture composed of 65% granodiorite in the Lesser Xing'an Range, 30% granite in Zhangguangcai Range and 5% epidiorite in the south‐eastern Songliao Basin, can be interpreted as the potential source compositions for the clastic sediments. This conclusion is reinforced by the major element of geochemistry composition and sandstone petrography. Relatively low Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) values in mudstones (48.14–69.26) and sandstones (50.78–59.96) indicate mild chemical weathering conditions in the source area. The chemical weathering history suggests that a cold and arid climate prevailed during the Late Cretaceous.",

      "abstract": "Major- and trace-element data together with Nd and Sr isotopic compositions and 40Ar/39Ar age determinations were obtained for Late Cretaceous and younger volcanic rocks from north-central Colorado, USA, in the Southern Rocky Mountains to assess the sources of mantle-derived melts in a region underlain by thick (≥150 km) continental lithosphere. Trachybasalt to trachyandesite lava flows and volcanic cobbles of the Upper Cretaceous Windy Gap Volcanic Member of the Middle Park Formation have low εNd(t) values from −3.4 to −13, 87Sr/86Sr(t) from ~0.705 to ~0.707, high large ion lithophile element/high field strength element ratios, and low Ta/Th (≤0.2) values. These characteristics are consistent with the production of mafic melts during the Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic Laramide orogeny through flux melting of asthenosphere above shallowly subducting and dehydrating oceanic lithosphere of the Farallon plate, followed by the interaction of these melts with preexisting, low εNd(t), continental lithospheric mantle during ascent. This scenario requires that asthenospheric melting occurred beneath continental lithosphere as thick as 200 km, in accordance with mantle xenoliths entrained in localized Devonian-age kimberlites. Such depths are consistent with the abundances of heavy rare earth elements (Yb, Sc) in the Laramide volcanic rocks, which require parental melts derived from garnet-bearing mantle source rocks. New 40Ar/39Ar ages from the Rabbit Ears and Elkhead Mountains volcanic fields confirm that mafic magmatism was reestablished in this region ca. 28 Ma after a hiatus of over 30 m.y. and that the locus of volcanism migrated to the west through time. These rocks have εNd(t) and 87Sr/86Sr(t) values equivalent to their older counterparts (−3.5 to −13 and 0.7038–0.7060, respectively), but they have higher average chondrite-normalized La/Yb values (~22 vs. ~10), and, for the Rabbit Ears volcanic field, higher and more variable Ta/Th values (0.29–0.43). The latter are general characteristics of all other post– 40 Ma volcanic rocks in north-central Colorado for which literature data are available. Transitions from low to intermediate Ta/Th mafic volcanism occurred diachronously across southwest North America and are interpreted to have been a consequence of melting of continental lithospheric mantle previously metasomatized by aqueous fluids derived from the underthrusted Farallon plate. Melting occurred as remnants of the Farallon plate were removed and the continental lithospheric mantle was conductively heated by upwelling asthenosphere. A similar model can be applied to post–40 Ma magmatism in north-central Colorado, with periodic, east to west, removal of stranded remnants of the Farallon plate from the base of the continental lithospheric mantle accounting for the production, and western migration, of volcanism. The estimated depth of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary in north-central Colorado (~150 km) indicates that the lithosphere remains too thick to allow widespread melting of upwelling asthenosphere even after lithospheric thinning in the Cenozoic. The preservation of thick continental lithospheric mantle may account for the absence of oceanic-island basalt–like basaltic volcanism (high Ta/Th values of ~1 and εNd[t] > 0), in contrast to areas of southwest North America that experienced larger-magnitude extension and lithosphere thinning, where oceanic-island basalt–like late Cenozoic basalts are common.",
